# Advanced AI-Driven Defect Detection System

## Overview

Welcome to the repository for the Advanced AI-Driven Defect Detection System. This project aims to revolutionize quality assurance in automotive manufacturing by implementing a state-of-the-art AI system that identifies defects in vehicle components with high accuracy. Our goal is to minimize defects, reduce costs associated with rework and recalls, and ensure that every vehicle component meets the highest standards of quality.

## Features

- **High Accuracy Defect Detection**: Utilizes advanced AI models to detect defects in automotive parts with exceptional accuracy.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Processes images and data in real-time to provide instant feedback on potential defects.
- **Cost Reduction**: Reduces costs associated with rework, recalls, and warranty claims by ensuring only high-quality components move forward in the manufacturing process.
- **Scalability**: Designed to be scalable across various types of automotive parts and manufacturing setups.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use Streamlit interface for operators and quality assurance personnel to interact with the system.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Streamlit
- Required Python libraries (specified in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ai-defect-detection.git
    cd ai-defect-detection
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Application

1. Prepare your dataset of automotive part images.
2. Start the Streamlit application:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

3. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to interact with the application.

## Usage

1. Upload your dataset of automotive part images through the Streamlit interface.
2. The application will preprocess the data, run the AI model for defect detection, and display the results.
3. Review the results and, if necessary, adjust the model parameters through the interface.
